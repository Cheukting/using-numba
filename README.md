## Power up your work with compiling and profiling - Using Numba Effectively

In this workshop, we gonna go through 3 notebooks (plus an optional NumPy tutorial) to get an idea of the inner working of Numba, try trouble shooting with compilation problems and put them into practice by profiling the code and apply Numba to it.

### Enviroment requirement

Recommended Python version: 3.10 - highly recommneded to use a new enviroment

Jupyter notebook/ lab etc - to run the notebooks

Numba, NumPy, Matplotlib, Requests - install [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) or we can install them in the notebooks

* Option 1 - [Install Anaconda locally](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

* Option 2 - [Code online with Anaconda Nucleus](https://anaconda.cloud/anaconda-tools)
